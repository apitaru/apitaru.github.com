  <h2>Amit Pitaru</h2>
<p>I am a technologist, audio-visual artist and educator based in Brooklyn, NY.</p>

<h2>Start With One</h2>
<p>I currently lead comunity-driven innovation projects at Google Creative Lab. Our work typically starts by working together with one person to <a href="https://g.co/startwithone">make something impactful with them and their community</a>. If you have an idea for a project or would like to join one, don't hesitate to reach out.</p>

<h2>Audio Visual Artist</h2>
<p>In the early 2000's I was part of the 'Interactive Art' scene and have exhibitted widely in museums and galleries. I have recently started to publicly share work again because NFTs have activated a creative community of artists just like 20 years ago. I've missed that. I post my work regularly on <a href="http://twitter.com/pitaru"> Twitter</a> (for everyone to enjoy for free) and am creating NFTs <a href="https://hicetnunc.art/pitaru">here</a> and <a hfer="https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Pitaru">here</a> for those who'd like to own one.</p>


<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>I helped found the <a href="http://sfpc.io">School for Poetic Computaiton</a> (and Kitchen Table Coders) with friends after many years of teaching at NYU ITP, Cooper Union and Pratt. I have not been actively teaching for some time now but do guest lectures.</p>

<h2>Friends and Family</h2>
<p>No achievement is made alone or worth the trouble without the support of friends and family. Make sure to spend time and share your ❤️ with them.</p>
